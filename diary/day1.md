# Day 1
- Literature research
- Data processing for SFT and DPO
- Ran DPO and SFT locally and on Colab

## Plan:
- More experiments (Cuda OOM even with "small" settings)
- GPT generated conversations to talk about single topic.
- Evaluation - both human and on hold out set
- Hopefully Docker image to serve models.
